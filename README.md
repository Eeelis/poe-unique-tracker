# poe-unique-tracker
[Path of Exile](https://www.pathofexile.com/) is an ARPG developed by Grinding Gear Games, in which players collect normal, magic, rare and unique items. This program allows players to check whether a copy of a unique item they find already exists in their stash. The program no longer works due to some API changes.
